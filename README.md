# Makey Maker

A tiny JavaScript library for making stuff with the [Makey Makey Go](http://http://shop.makeymakey.com/products/makey-makey-go).

## About

The Makey Makey Go is a simple device for connecting real-world stuff to computers. It turns more-or-less conductive things into touch interfaces. This means you can make almost anything into a touchable button. Want a banana button? Makey Makey Go can help!
Need a doughnut control? Again, Makey Makey Go is the answer!
